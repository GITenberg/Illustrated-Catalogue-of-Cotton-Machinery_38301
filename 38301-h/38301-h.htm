<h1>OPENING AND PICKING MACHINERY.</h1>
<p>
The Opening and Picking of cotton should have
the same careful attention as the Carding and Spinning,
although the latter processes may seem to
some to be more important. Much more attention
is being given to this Department everywhere
to-day than formerly, and better equipments of
machinery are being used. The same equipment
is not equally good for all classes of work, as the
machinery must be designed and adjusted for the
particular kind of stock to be used.
</p>
<p>
Unless the cotton is well opened and cleaned,
and good even laps are made, the Carding will
suffer, and the Card Clothing will soon be damaged,
which means poor and costly work.
</p>
<p>
We invite with every confidence all possible
investigation into the construction and improved
design of our Opening and Picking machinery,
and the work it is doing in the mills. This entire
line of machinery is substantially built, very simple,
and contains many valuable improvements.

<br>
PATENT HOPPER BALE OPENER
</p>

<a name="9">{9}</a>
<h1>HOPPER BALE OPENER.</h1>
<p>
An investigation of the present methods of
handling cotton before it reaches the Pickers
shows that in a large percentage of mills there
are opportunities for greatly reducing the labor
cost and at the same time improving in a marked
degree the quality of opening and mixing. The
saving which can be effected in labor, and the
better results obtained by a more thorough opening
of the cotton and a more even mixing, can hardly
be appreciated except by those who have seen it
demonstrated by the use of our Hopper Bale
Opener.
</p>
<p>
This machine is extensively used in England and
on the Continent, where it is giving most satisfactory
results. It is filling a need which has long existed.
</p>
<p>
<b>LABOR SAVING</b>&mdash;A bale of cotton can be thoroughly
opened <i>without damage to the staple</i> in six to
ten minutes, which means that one hand can open
upwards of 150,000 to 200,000 lbs. per week and
still have time for taking care of bagging, ties, etc.
Even when the weekly consumption of cotton is
very much less than this there is a saving in labor,
as the quick completion of the work means that the
attendant can give his attention to something else.
</p>
<p>
<b>QUALITY OF WORK</b>&mdash;The fluffy condition of the
cotton as it is delivered from the Hopper Bale
Opener shows the very thorough manner in which
it is opened. Although the cotton is fed to the
machine in large matted sections taken directly
from the bales as they lie around the horizontal
feeding apron, no bunches come through. When
cotton is opened and mixed by hand the result is
not what is generally supposed. The stock is still
in large bunches and matted to such an extent that
when fed into the Hoppers of ordinary Openers it
is impossible to obtain an even or thorough mixing.
</p>
<a name="10">{10}</a>
<p>
<b>THE FEEDING APRON</b> of the Hopper Bale Opener
usually extends four feet back of the Hopper which
enables the operator to group a number of bales
around the machine so as to take cotton first from
one and then from another. This gives an even
mixing of the stock from the various bales. If it is
desired this idea can be carried still further by
making the Feeding Apron longer, so as to allow of
taking cotton from a greater number of bales.
</p>
<p>
<b>METHOD OF WORKING</b>&mdash;The matted sections taken
direct from the bale and placed on the slowly
driven Horizontal Feeding Apron move forward
into the Hopper and are taken by the more rapidly
moving Spiked Elevating Apron, which subjects the
cotton to a sort of combing action. At the top of
this Apron there is a spiked Cylinder which further
combs the cotton and throws back into the Hopper
any unopened pieces. A Stripping Beater with
stiff leather blades strips the stock from the Spiked
Apron and delivers it onto the short delivery Apron
at the front of the machine.
</p>
<p>
<b>DELIVERY ARRANGEMENTS</b>&mdash;The ordinary or
standard delivery arrangement is shown in the cut,
<a href="#8">page 8</a>, and in the outline drawing, <a href="#12">page 12</a>. We
have recently designed a double apron delivery for
use with Condenser and Blower systems, where the
cotton has to be carried quite a distance. This
arrangement does away with the necessity of
passing the stock through a fan and is approved by
the Insurance Companies.
</p>
<p>
The cotton being delivered into the conveying
pipe ahead of the "Blower Fan," there is
no fire risk due to hard substances passing through
or stock getting caught in the fan. We have
designed many special delivery arrangements to
meet the various conditions which present themselves,
including a suitable delivery for use
with either lattice distributing systems or blowing
systems.
</p>
<a name="11">{11}</a>
<p>
<b>DISTRIBUTING SYSTEMS</b>&mdash;The installation of this
Hopper Bale Opener makes a distributing system
more advantageous and satisfactory. We have
equipped many Opening Rooms with Distributing
Lattices which deliver the cotton directly into the
Hoppers of the Self-feeding Openers, thus saving
another handling.
</p>
<p>
When the Hopper Bale Opener is located some
distance from the distributing lattice, the latter
may be fed by a blower and condenser system, and
when the distance is very short an elevating lattice
is used, dropping the cotton directly on the distributing
lattice. We are always glad to take up
special cases and make recommendations in connection
with the conveying and distribution of cotton
either for short or long distances.
</p>
<p>
An advantage which is not usually thought of
or appreciated is the more even Breaker laps
obtained where a Hopper Bale Opener and distributing
system are used. The Hoppers of the
Feeders are more evenly fed and the stock is in a
much better condition than when mixed and fed by
hand.
</p>
<p>
<b>CONSTRUCTION</b>&mdash;The machine is very strongly
built throughout. An extra large Hopper is an
advantage possessed by this Opener. The Spiked
Elevating Lattice is made on a new patented
system and the slats on same are of heavy selected
stock.
</p>
<p>
<b>DRIVING PULLEYS AND SPEEDS</b>&mdash;The Driving
Pulleys are on the right hand side when facing the
Hopper or Feed and are 11 in. dia., 3 in. face, tight
and loose, and should be driven at about 582 revs.
per minute.
</p>
<p>
<b>PRODUCTION</b>&mdash;150,000 to 200,000 lbs. per week of
60 hours.
</p>
<p>
<b>FLOOR SPACE</b>&mdash;The machine with short Feeding
Lattice, as shown on the illustration, <a href="#8">page 8</a>,
is 13 ft. 1-1/4 in. x 6 ft. 10 in.

AUTOMATIC HOPPER FEEDER
</p>
<a name="15">{15}</a>
<h1>AUTOMATIC HOPPER FEEDER. </h1>
<p>
<b>HOPPER</b>&mdash;This is extra large and capable of
holding 400 to 450 pounds of cotton.
</p>
<p>
<b>SPIKED ELEVATING APRON</b> runs over large flanged
blocks and is extra strong.
</p>
<p>
<b>STRIPPING COMB OR ROLLER</b>&mdash;This works in
conjunction with the Spiked Apron, and is very simple
and durable. It is self-cleaning and is easily
adjusted by means of a handle on one side of the
machine. This handle can be locked in position
after an adjustment is made, and the arrangement,
although operated from one side of the Feeder,
gives a positive parallel motion, and consequently
a true setting of the Stripping Comb.
</p>
<p>
<b>PIN BEATER</b> takes the cotton from the Spiked
Apron. The stock, after passing over the cleaning
grids, drops on the Delivery Apron.
</p>
<p>
<b>KNOCK-OFF ARRANGEMENT</b>&mdash;This is simple and
durable, and is so designed as to be easily
connected to the knock-off on the Breaker Lapper or
other machine which follows.
</p>
<p>
<b>APRONS</b> all have strong and easily adjusted
tightening devices.
</p>
<p>
<b>SIMPLICITY</b>&mdash;Our Feeder is reduced to the
simplest design possible consistent with even and good
work, and has no troublesome cone drums.
</p>
<p>
<b>COMBINATIONS</b> of this Feeder with the various
Opening and Picking Machines are made to suit
any special requirements of the mill. The Feeder
when combined with an Opener is driven from a
pulley on the Cylinder or Beater shaft, and when
feeding on to the Apron of a Lapper is driven from
the Lapper Countershaft.
</p>
<p>
<b>DRIVING PULLEY AND SPEED</b>&mdash;The Driving Pulley
is 10 in. dia., 2-1/4-in. face, and should be driven at
about 550 revs. per minute.
</p>
<p>
<b>FLOOR SPACE</b>&mdash;Length, 10 ft. 5 in.; width, 5 ft. 6 in.

SELF-FEEDING OPENER WITH 30-IN. CYLINDER
</p>
<a name="17">{17}</a>
<h1>SELF-FEEDING OPENER. </h1>
<p>
This is a combination of the Automatic Hopper
Feeder with an Opener Section built as one
machine. The Beater in the Opener Section may
be a two-blade rigid Beater, 18 in. dia., or a 30-in.
dia. Special Cylinder, which is shown and described
on <a href="#18">page 18</a>.
</p>
<p>
This machine may be arranged for trunking
connections, as shown in the cut on the <a href="#16">opposite page</a>,
or it may be attached directly to a Breaker
Lapper, forming a Combined Self-feeding Opener
and Breaker Lapper (see <a href="#30">page 30</a> for cut of this
machine).
</p>
<p>
<b>DRIVING PULLEY</b>&mdash;Self-feeding Opener with 18
in. Beater, 9 in. dia., 4-1/4 in. face; with 30-in. Cylinder,
16 in. dia., 4-1/4 in. face. Other sizes can be furnished.
</p>
<p>
<b>SPEEDS</b>&mdash;1,450 revs. per minute for 18-in. Beater
and 550 revs. per minute for 30-in. Cylinder when
running with ordinary cotton. For long staple cottons
the Beater speed is reduced to 800 to 1,050
revs. per minute and the Cylinder speed to 300
to 450 revs. per minute.

30-IN. SPECIAL CYLINDER
</p>
<a name="19">{19}</a>
<h1>30-INCH SPECIAL CYLINDER. </h1>
<p>
This 30-inch Cylinder is specially designed for
use in Self-Feeding Openers where these machines
are arranged for trunk connection or combined with
Breaker Lappers.
</p>
<p>
The large diameter makes it possible to use
more grid bars than with the blade beaters. The
main points considered in the design of this 30-inch
cylinder were, more thorough opening of the cotton,
greater production without injury to the staple, and
better cleaning.
</p>
<p>
These Cylinders are made from steel boiler
plates, and the steel fingers are fastened on by
rivets. These fingers are so arranged that in one
revolution they strike all points along the entire
width of the feed rolls. In case of accident to
fingers, caused by some hard substance getting into
the machine, the damaged fingers can be easily
replaced.
</p>
<p>
We have adopted the 30-inch Special Cylinder,
believing it to be preferable to those of larger
diameter.

AUTOMATIC CLEANING TRUNK (10-FT. SECTION)
</p>
<a name="21">{21}</a>
<h1>CLEANING TRUNK. </h1>
<p>
On the <a href="#20">opposite page</a> is shown a 10-ft. section
of Automatic Cleaning Trunk. It is usual to install
two of these sections, making 20 ft., and to suspend
same from the ceiling.
</p>
<p>
The cotton passes over Transverse Grids A and
the leaf and dirt drop between the Grids into a
series of compartments B, which are automatically
cleaned out by air draft from a Fan. Each compartment
has a hinged door or bottom C, which
when dropped leaves an opening into the exhaust
air pipe D. The hinged doors are dropped one at
a time, and the openings are shown at G.
</p>
<p>
The Fan is connected to the exhaust air pipe D,
and is only running while the Trunk is being
cleaned.
</p>
<p>
The removable doors E give access to the top
of the Trunk, and the brackets F are for the
supporting rods.
</p>
<p>
One of the advantages of this Trunk is that it
can be hung from the ceiling out of the way and
not occupy valuable floor space. It is carefully
built and the joints of the doors are covered with
leather to prevent leaks.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#59">Page 59</a> shows a system where 20 ft. of
Automatic Cleaning Trunk is used together with the
necessary Conducting Trunk; the Opener being on
the first floor and the Breaker Lapper with Gauge
Box and Condenser on the second.

ENGLISH PATTERN CLEANING TRUNK (TWO 4-FT. SECTIONS)
</p>
<a name="23">{23}</a>
<p>
Cleaning Trunk is of special advantage to mills
using low grade stock. All cotton contains more
or less light dirt and leaf, which it is difficult to
entirely remove in the Lappers, on account of the
fan draft essential to the formation of a good sheet
on the screens carrying some of the lighter impurities
along with the cotton. The passing of the
stock over the transverse Grids in the Cleaning
Trunk at a low velocity provides an efficient means
for removing this dirt and leaf.
</p>
<p>
We also build an <i>English pattern Trunk</i>, which is
shown in the illustration on <a href="#22">page 22</a>. This Trunk
is supported by stands which rest on the floor, and
is built in 4-ft. sections, several of these being
coupled together. Although not automatic, it is
easily cleaned by dropping the doors which cover
the entire bottom of the Trunk and carry the Grids.
In the illustration one of these doors is shown
down, and the sheet iron Grids are plainly visible.

SINGLE BEATER BREAKER LAPPER WITH
GAUGE BOX AND CONDENSER
</p>
<a name="25">{25}</a>
<h1>BREAKER LAPPERS. </h1>
<p>
On <a href="#24">page 24</a> is shown our Single Beater Breaker Lapper
with Gauge Box and Condenser, and on <a href="#28">page 28</a> the same
machine with a Cage Section.
</p>
<p>
<b>GAUGE BOX AND CONDENSER</b>&mdash;We strongly recommend
the use of Gauge Boxes and Condensers when the Breaker
Lappers and Openers are on different floors, or the stock has
to be carried any distance. Under these conditions there is a
considerable quantity of cotton passing between the Opener
and Lapper, which on account of the stopping and starting of
the latter is liable to make thick and thin places in the lap.
</p>
<p>
The use of the Condenser and Gauge Box overcomes this
difficulty as the cotton is received under these varying conditions
and the Gauge Box acts as an Evener and delivers a
uniform supply to the Feed Rolls behind the Beater. When
the connection between the Opener and Breaker Lapper is
short the Cage Section can be used without difficulty.
</p>
<p>
The Condenser Fan, which is of extra large size, is conveniently
placed under the Gauge Box and Condenser Section.
The Gauge Box has glass panels on the two sides and front,
so that the cotton can be seen and the feed regulated.
</p>
<p>
<b>BEATERS</b>&mdash;Although the cuts show Single Beater
machines, we build them with two Beaters if required or with
one Cylinder and one Beater.
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPROVED CALENDER HEAD</b>&mdash;Our Lappers have many
valuable special features, including our improved Calender
Head, which allows the machine to be stopped by the Drop
Handle without breaking the lap. When the lap is of the
required length and the machine knocks off, the large Lap
Rolls as well as the Calender Rolls, Feed Apron and Cages
stop, and the lap is not broken.
</p>
<p>
If the lap continues to revolve after the machine has
knocked off, it becomes sticky and there is likely to be trouble
from split laps back of the Cards. <i>Our arrangement prevents
this and also enables the machine to be stopped at any time
during the formation of a lap without breaking the lap</i>.

FEED ROLLS, TOP CAGE AND COVER<br>
Showing Bushed Bearings and Easy Method of Removing the Top Cage
</p>
<a name="27">{27}</a>
<p>
<b>GEARS EASILY REMOVED</b>&mdash;All the large gears are
fastened by an improved method. Instead of driving them onto
keys, which makes their removal difficult, we use with each
large gear a square key let into the shaft, and two set screws.
The gears fit the keys, but not tightly enough to prevent their
easy removal after loosening the set screws.
</p>
<p class=center>
<img src="images/i027.jpg" alt="[Illustration]"  border=1>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>CLUTCH GEARS</b>&mdash;The Calender Rolls are stopped and
started by large Clutch Gears which are a great improvement
over the common Drop Shaft and Gear. With this method
the starting strain is distributed over all the teeth in the
Clutch Gears, entirely doing away with the frequent breakages
under the old system.
</p>
<p>
<b>BEARINGS</b>&mdash;Where it is possible the bearings are made
in bush form, as shown in cut <a href="#26">page 26</a>, thus reducing to a
minimum the time taken to make replacements and the cost
of same. Our bearings are very easy to adjust, and their
special form prevents oil from getting to the inside of the
machine. All high speed Shafts, viz., Fan, Side and Beater
Shafts, have ring oiling bearings.
</p>
<a name="28">{28}</a>
<p class=center>
<img src="images/i028.jpg" alt="[Illustration]"  border=1>
</p>
<a name="29">{29}</a>
<p>
<b>TOP CAGES AND COVERS</b>&mdash;The Top Cages of our
Lappers are easily removed, as will be seen by referring to the
cut, <a href="#26">page 26</a>. The sides of the cage cover or bonnet fit
snugly over the bushed bearings. To remove the cage or
bushings, it is only necessary to turn back the cover. These
covers are all made with oil holes directly over the bearing,
so it is not necessary to raise the cover for the purpose of
oiling.
</p>
<p>
<b>NO TILTING OF LAP RACKS</b>&mdash;The Lap Racks slide up
and down on steel shafts, which entirely prevent the tilting
of the Racks and consequent breakages.
</p>
<p>
<b>SHAFTS</b>&mdash;Our Beater and Fan shafts are made from a
very hard iron specially mixed to give long life to these high
speed shafts.
</p>
<p>
A countershaft complete with pulleys is attached to each
Lapper.
</p>
<p>
<b>DRIVING PULLEYS</b>&mdash;One-beater Breaker Lappers 16 in.
dia., 4-1/4 in. face, T. & L.
</p>
<p>
Two-beater Breaker Lappers or One-beater Breaker Lappers
with extra Cage Section or Condenser and Gauge Box

In combinations which have 3 beaters to be driven from
one countershaft of machine, 16 in. dia., 6-1/4 in. face, T. & L.
</p>
<p>
Other sizes can be furnished.
</p>
<p>
<b>SPEEDS</b>&mdash;The usual speed of all lapper countershafts is
435 revs. per minute, which gives 1,450 revs. per minute of the
Beaters, and 550 revs. per minute of Cylinders, for ordinary
cotton. For long staple cottons the beater speed is reduced
to 800 to 1,050 revs. per minute and the Cylinder speed to 300
to 450 revs. per minute.
</p>
<p>
<b>PRODUCTION</b>&mdash;On ordinary cotton 15,000 to 20,000 lbs.
per week of 60 hours. In some cases the production is far in
excess of these figures. For long staple cottons, 10,000 to
15,000 lbs.

SELF-FEEDING OPENER (30-IN. CYLINDER) AND
SINGLE BEATER BREAKER LAPPER
</p>
<a name="31">{31}</a>
<h1>COMBINATION MACHINES. </h1>
<p>
On the opposite page is shown a Self-feeding
Opener with 30-in. Cylinder combined with a
Single Beater Breaker Lapper. This is a very
popular combination and, it will be noted, is built
as one straight machine. A floor plan and elevation
are shown on <a href="#54">page 54</a>. This same combination
with an 18-in. Beater instead of the 30-in.
Cylinder in the Opener Section is shown in plan
and elevation on <a href="#55">page 55</a>.
</p>
<p>
We also build a Self-feeding Opener with Cage
Section and Calender Head, which is well adapted
to work Egyptian and Sea Island cottons. (See
<a href="#53">page 53</a> for plan and elevation.)
</p>
<p>
Self-feeding Openers when built as separate
machines can be placed on any floor above or below
the Breaker Lappers, or on the same floor, the connections
being made by Automatic Cleaning Trunks,
Conducting Trunks, and galvanized iron pipe, as
the conditions may require.
</p>
<p>
On <a href="#56">pages 56 and 57</a> we show Single Beater
Breaker Lappers with Gauge Boxes and Condensers
connected to Self-feeding Openers by short sections
of Conducting Trunk. The Breakers are on
the floor above the Openers. One drawing shows
the Self-feeding Opener with 18-in. Beater, and
the other with 30-in. Cylinder.

SINGLE BEATER FINISHER LAPPER
</p>
<a name="33">{33}</a>
<h1>INTERMEDIATE AND FINISHER LAPPERS. </h1>
<p>
These machines have our improved Calender Head,
which has already been described in connection with Breaker
Lappers. Each machine has a countershaft and pulleys complete
with stands as shown.
</p>
<p>
<b>BEATER BOXES</b>&mdash;All our beater boxes are fixed and our
feed rolls adjustable, which we consider superior to having
the beaters adjustable. After thorough investigation and
long practice we have found that adjustable beaters are liable
to get out of line, causing them to heat and wear quickly.
</p>
<p>
<b>DRAFT REGULATION</b>&mdash;The air chamber from fan to
cage section on each side of the machine is supplied with
a damper, operated from the outside of the machine. With
this arrangement the air can be drawn through the top and
bottom cages in any desired proportion, and the operator can
regulate the drafts to give the best results.
</p>
<p>
<b>BEATERS</b>&mdash;Two-blade (18 in. dia.) beaters are mostly
used, but we furnish the Houghton patent beater with corrugated
teeth, or carding beaters, when specified.
</p>
<p>
<b>OUTSIDE HANDLES FOR DUST DOORS</b>&mdash;We have
recently added handles on the outside of the machine for dropping
the cut-off board under the grids. The dirt and leaf
which collect on this board are liable to fill up the grids
if not regularly removed. The outside handles make the
dropping of the cut-off boards very convenient and much
reduce the liability of neglect on the part of the attendant.
</p>
<p>
<h2>DRIVING PULLEYS </h2>

</p>
<p>
Two-beater machines, 16 in. dia., 5-1/4 in. face, T. & L.
Other sizes can be furnished.
</p>
<p>
<b>SPEEDS</b>&mdash;The usual speed of countershafts is 435 revs.
per minute, which gives 1,450 revs. of the two-blade beaters
and 1,063 revs. of carding beaters. For long staple cottons the
beater speed is reduced to 800 to 1,050 revs. per minute.
</p>
<p>
<b>PRODUCTION</b>&mdash;On ordinary cotton 12,000 to 15,000 pounds
per week of sixty hours. These productions are often exceeded.
For long staple cottons, 8,000 to 10,000 pounds. For production

IMPROVED EVENER FOR INTERMEDIATE AND FINISHER LAPPERS
</p>
<a name="35">{35}</a>
<h1>IMPROVED EVENER. </h1>
<p>
The obtaining of even laps is a matter of prime
importance. The demand for more perfect work
has emphasized the need for better picking, and for
laps which are even not only in total weight, but
throughout. Our improved design fills the following
essential qualifications of a good Evener.
</p>
<p>
1st&mdash;Sensitiveness and prompt action, so that
any variation in the weight passing under the
Evener Plates will be taken care of immediately.
</p>
<p>
2d&mdash;Steadiness of running and action, so that
there is no tendency to "hunt," <i>i. e.</i>, the cone
belt will at once take its new position without traveling
up and down.
</p>
<p>
3d&mdash;Simplicity and few moving parts.
</p>
<p>
4th&mdash;Small amount of attention required.
</p>
<p>
The direct method of communicating any movement
of the Evener Plates to the cone belt, the
multiplication of this movement and the short
cones are features which help to secure sensitiveness
and prompt action.
</p>
<p>
The small amount of lost motion between the
Evener Plates and the cone belt, and the free movement
of the belt shipper rod, which runs on rollers,
make the action positive and steady.
</p>
<p>
The cut on <a href="#34">page 34</a> shows our Evener and
indicates the simplicity of same. The number of
moving parts has been reduced to a minimum. The
Evener Plates and feed roll give great cleaning
capacity on account of the bite of the Plates being
close to the Beater. The Evener Plates are on top
of a 3-in. dia. steel feed roll, which gives a very
rigid support and ensures all the variation in the
thickness of the cotton under the plates being
communicated to the Evener belt.
</p>
<p>
The cones are conveniently placed under the
feeding apron, and the lower cone runs in an
adjustable cradle which allows the belt to be made
endless and keeps it at an even tension at all times.

FLAT GRINDING MOTION
</p>

<a name="63">{63}</a>

<p>
The following paragraphs briefly describe
some of the points of advantage in the design and
construction of our machines:
</p>
<p>
<b>CYLINDERS AND DOFFERS</b> are carefully balanced at a
high speed and are ground after being turned, making a perfectly
true surface for the Card Clothing.
</p>
<p>
<b>GOOD SELVAGES</b>&mdash;Both Cylinders and Doffers are
clothed to the extreme edges, which prevents ragged selvages.
</p>
<p>
<b>PROTECTION OF CLOTHING</b>&mdash;The Doffers are
provided with flanges to protect the Clothing, keep the edges
firm and prevent the wire from being knocked down.
Turned iron flanges on the Bends, and Segment Rings fixed
to the inside of the lower part of the framing protect the
edges of the Cylinders all the way round. The Doffers are
made 1/8 in. wider than the Cylinders in order to keep the
edges of the latter clean.
</p>
<p>
<b>PREVENTION OF ACCUMULATION OF FLY</b>&mdash;The
Segment Rings which are fitted close to the edges of the
Cylinder project in such a way as to form a circle two inches
larger than the diameter of the Cylinder. The Underscreens
are attached to these Segment Rings, and this arrangement
makes it impossible for fly to collect inside the Screens or
about the edges of the Cylinders and Doffers.
</p>
<p>
<b>ELECTRICAL TESTS</b>&mdash;All Bends and Flats are tested at
our works by special electrical apparatus, and this method of
testing gives greater accuracy than can be obtained in any
other way. More accurate Bends and Flats make closer
settings possible.
</p>
<p>
<b>PERCENTAGE AND ALL CASING-OFF PLATES</b> are made
of steel, polished inside and out, and bent to conform to the
surface of the cylinder. Each plate is set by gauge to the
Cylinder, and the closing up of all air spaces makes the
accumulation of fly and cloudy carding impossible.
</p>
<p>
<b>ADJUSTMENTS</b>&mdash;Convenient adjusting arrangements with
setting screws and lock nuts are provided for the Knife Plates,
Doffers and Licker-ins. These are all on the outside of the
machine and are accessible and easily adjusted.
</p>
<a name="64">{64}</a>
<p class=center>
<img src="images/i064.jpg" alt="[Illustration]"  border=1>
</p>

<a name="65">{65}</a>
<p>
<b>LICKER-IN SHIELDS</b>&mdash;To prevent the accumulation of
fly around the bearings and pedestals and the climbing of oil
over the ends of the Licker-in onto the clothing, we supply
stationary shields at each end.
</p>
<p>
<b>UNDERSCREENS AND FEED PLATES</b>&mdash;Our
Underscreens are specially heavy and well constructed, and our
Feed Plates are very carefully finished and fitted. We supply
special Underscreens and Feed Plates for long staple cotton.
</p>
<p class=center>
<img src="images/i065.jpg" alt="[Illustration]"  border=1>
</p>
<p>
<b>ADJUSTABLE CYLINDER PEDESTALS</b>&mdash;The bearings for
the Cylinders are made of phosphor bronze and the pedestals
are adjustable either vertically or horizontally. This is a very
important point, because the concentricity of the Cylinder
with the Bends can be maintained as the bearings wear. The
construction of our Card side is such that a very rigid support
is given to the pedestals.
</p>
<p>
<b>FLAT RELEASE</b>&mdash;This is a very simple and convenient
attachment to the Flat Driving Arrangement, which makes
one of the worm gears loose on its shaft and enables the Flats
to be easily turned by hand with a suitable wrench.
</p>
<p>
<b>CONICAL BUSHINGS</b>&mdash;The Cylinders are fastened onto
the shafts by means of split conical bushings which are forced
into place and prevent any possibility of the Cylinders working
loose.

PATENT SETTING ARRANGEMENT FOR FLATS
</p>

<a name="67">{67}</a>

<h1>PATENT SETTING ARRANGEMENT FOR FLATS. </h1>
<p>
The cuts on <a href="#66">page 66</a> are sectional and plan
views of this arrangement.
</p>
<p>
A&mdash;Index Nut which bears against outside of
Rigid Bend D.
</p>
<p>
B&mdash;Setting Key with fluted teeth, which gear
into the teeth on Nut C.
</p>
<p>
C&mdash;Toothed Steel Nut which bears against the
inside of Rigid Bend D.
</p>
<p>
D&mdash;Rigid Conical Bend which is moved in
or out.
</p>
<p>
E&mdash;Flexible Conical Bend which rests on D
and carries the Flats.
</p>
<p>
As the Index Nuts A and the Toothed Nuts C
are turned one way or the other, they move the
Rigid Bend D in or out, and thus raise or lower the
Flexible Bend E.
</p>
<p>
The Flats rest on the Flexible Bend E and are
raised or lowered with it. Each division on the
Index Nuts A represents 1/1000 part of an inch, and by
turning these Nuts one division, the Flats are raised
or lowered to this extent.
</p>
<p>
Our Patent Conical Concentric Bends have five
setting points on each side of the machine. The
Bends and Flats can be kept perfectly concentric
with the Cylinder at every point until the Clothing is
worn out. No other arrangement has secured such
accuracy nor has any adjustment yet been invented
which approaches this one for reliability and simplicity.
</p>
<p>
When the Flats are once set they remain set,
and cannot be tampered with. Special wrenches
are required for turning the Index Nuts A and Lock
Nuts C, and if these wrenches are kept by the one
who has charge of the settings, no unauthorized
person can change same.
</p>
<p>
Close accurate settings enable our Card to do
the finest quality of work and at the same time
give the maximum production.
</p>
<a name="68">{68}</a>

<h1>WILLIAMS PATENT STRIPPING MOTION. </h1>
<p class=center>
<img src="images/i068.jpg" alt="[Illustration]"  border=1>
</p>
<p>
This Motion enables the Card to do better work
and increases the life of the Flat clothing.
</p>
<p>
Perfect Flat Stripping can only be obtained
with a Motion which keeps the Comb at an even and
fixed distance from the wire clothing at all points
over the entire width of the Flat. The Williams
Patent Stripping Motion, for which we hold sole
rights for America, meets this essential requirement
and therefore does what no other Motion has
succeeded in doing. In the old system, the Comb is
kept at a fixed distance from the framing of the
machine, which is correct as long as there is no
variation in the position of the Flats as they pass
under the Comb. In practice, it is impossible to
<a name="69">{69}</a>
prevent a certain amount of tilting or raising of the
Flats, due to the wearing of the chains and
sprockets and also to dirt getting under the Flats.
With the Williams system the stripping is perfectly
done no matter what the tilting may be, and even if
the Flats are forced away from their true position
through any cause, the Comb follows the Flat and
maintains its distance. There is no comb which
will not catch and damage the wire if the setting
becomes too close on account of the clearance not
being kept uniform.
</p>
<p>
In the Williams Stripping Motion the Comb
stock is mounted at each end in bearings which slide
in guides away from or toward the Flats. The
accurate setting of the Comb is maintained by
means of shoes which press against the working
seatings of the Flats and govern the position of the
sliding Comb stock bearings. The shoes have
adjusting screws to regulate the setting of the
Comb, and the shape of the shoes is such as to allow
for the heel of the flat. The sliding bearings of the
Comb stock are pressed inward by springs which
keep the shoes against the working seatings of the
Flat. The Comb blade is given a receding motion
which effectually strips all impurities from the wire.
This action, together with the fact that it is impossible
for the wire on the Flats to be forced into the
Comb through the accumulation of dirt or fly on the
blocks or Flat seatings, makes this Stripping Motion
the most perfect on the market.

to fine work, 100s and 110s; fine work, 120s and 130s.
</p>
<p>
Doffers are usually 10 numbers higher or finer
than Cylinders.
</p>
<p>
There is considerable variation in the Clothing
used for Tops. Some prefer thinner set than the
Cylinders, others about the same as the Cylinders,
and a few the same numbers as the Doffers.

<h1>DRAWING FRAMES. </h1>
<p>
The Howard & Bullough Patent Electric Stop
Motion Drawing Frame has proved one of the most
successful machines ever invented, and there are
large numbers of deliveries at work in every Cotton
Spinning country.
</p>
<p>
We build both Electric and Mechanical Stop
Motion Frames, but the great majority of our orders
are for machines with Electric Stop Motions.
</p>
<p>
The quality of sliver produced by these machines
cannot be surpassed; a great saving in waste
"single" and roller laps is effected, and production
is increased.
</p>
<p>
Machines stop:
</p>
<p class="cite">
1st&mdash;When sliver breaks at back or a can runs out. <br>
2d&mdash;When top or bottom front roll laps up. <br>
3d&mdash;When sliver breaks in front. <br>
4th&mdash;When cans are full. <br>
5th&mdash;When back electric roll or clearer laps up.
</p>
<p>
On account of the positive and quick action of
the Electric Stop Motions, machines can be run at
a much higher speed, in case of necessity, than
Mechanical Stop Motion Frames.
</p>
<p>
The tops of Electric Stop Motion Frames, being
free from the many small parts and projections
which are a necessity on Mechanical Stop Motion
Frames, are much more easily kept clean, and
"fly" is not carried into the sliver, besides which
a great many delicate and troublesome Mechanical
Stop Motion parts are done away with.

<a name="85">{85}</a>
<p>
<b>FRAMING AND CONSTRUCTION</b>&mdash;The machines are
built with low, rigid framing. Can tables set into or on top
of the floor.
</p>
<p>
<b>BOTTOM FLUTED ROLLS</b> are made in one length and
are irregularly fluted so as to prevent cutting of top rolls.
The usual diameters are 1-3/8 in. front, 1-1/8 in. second, third and
fourth lines.
</p>
<p>
<b>TOP ROLLS</b> are usually 1 in. dia. on iron. The front line
can have Loose Boss or Loose Ends; the latter are now in
extensive use and are generally preferred.
</p>
<p>
<b>ROLLER STANDS</b> are made with separate adjustable slides
or bearings, so arranged that the top and bottom rolls move
together when setting for different lengths of staple. The
Roller Stands and Slides have brasses cast in them for roller
bearings.
</p>
<p>
<b>CALENDER ROLLS</b> are made of steel, turned, ground and
polished.
</p>
<p>
<b>DRAFT GEARING</b>&mdash;All Draft and Roller Gears are cut.
Changes of Draft are very easily made, and the gearing is
well protected with polished covers.
</p>
<p>
<b>COILERS</b> are made for cans 36 ins. long, 9, 10, 11 or 12 ins.
dia. as required.
</p>
<p>
<b>TENSION</b>&mdash;Our fine pitch gearing for the take-up of the
sliver between the fluted rolls and the Calender rolls enables a
nice adjustment to be made for either ordinary or metallic rolls,
and reduces the stretching, sagging and breakage of the sliver,
preventing stoppage and waste.
</p>
<p>
<b>TRUMPETS</b>&mdash;These are made separate from the calender
plates and can easily be taken out. This method is an advantage
over the old style, as trumpets wear in time and when
worn do not sufficiently condense the sliver. With this system
they can easily be replaced.
</p>
<p>
<b>BACK GUIDES</b> for both Electric and Mechanical Stop
Motion Frames are designed so as to separate the slivers and
keep kinks from going into the rolls, thus preventing lumpy
and uneven work.

</p>

<a name="87">{87}</a>
<p>
<b>CLEARERS</b>&mdash;Both top and bottom rolls have Clearers.
We apply a patented and very successful Clearer to the Calender
rolls which prevents fly from sticking to them and being
carried in to the sliver.
</p>
<p>
<b>WEIGHT RELIEVING MOTION</b>&mdash;This is applied to all
frames for taking the pressure off the rolls when the frames
are stopped.
</p>
<p>
All rolls are weighted separately. Usual weights are 20
lbs. front line; 18 lbs. second line; 16 lbs. third line; 14 lbs.
fourth line.
</p>
<p>
<b>TRAVERSE MOTION</b> is applied to all frames with leather
covered top rolls.
</p>
<p>
<b>METALLIC TOP AND BOTTOM ROLLS</b>&mdash;The front bottom
roll is usually 1-3/8 in. dia., and the other three lines of bottom
rolls as well as the top rolls, all 1-1/8 in. dia.
</p>
<p>
Front and second lines are usually 32 pitch; third line 24
pitch and back line 16 pitch. The top rolls have Loose Ends.
Weights usually 14 lbs. on all lines.
</p>
<p>
<b>ERMEN TOP CLEARERS</b>&mdash;The cloth of these Clearers
revolves over 2 rolls (one of which is positively driven) and
comes in contact with all the top rolls. This revolving clearer
is placed inside of our top clearer cover, and is stripped by a
Comb through an opening in the top of the cover. This clearer
meets with great favor in fine mills, where combed long staple
cotton is worked.
</p>
<p>
<b>DRIVING PULLEY AND SPEED</b>&mdash;The Driving Pulley on
the Bottom Shaft is usually 16 in. dia., 3 in. or 4 in. face and
can be placed at either end of the frame. The usual speed of
this shaft is 250 r. p. m., which gives a calculated speed of 363
r. p. m. of Front Roll. One rev. of shaft equals 1-5/11 of Front
Roll.

<h2>DRAFT CALCULATIONS.</h2>

<p class=center>
<img src="images/i094.jpg" alt="[Illustration]"  border=1>
</p>
<p>
The above figures are for Total Draft up to and
including the 3-in. dia. Calender Rolls. When
Graduated Pitch Metallic Rolls are used, and it is
desired to figure drafts between them, the following
equivalents are approximately correct:
</p>
<p>
1-3/8-in. dia. Roll, 32 pitch, taken as 11/6-in. or 1.83-in. dia.<br>
1-1/4-in. dia. Roll, 32 pitch, taken as 10/6-in. or 1.67-in. dia.<br>
1-1/8-in. dia. Roll, 32 pitch, taken as 9/6-in. or 1.50-in. dia.<br>
1-in. dia. Roll, 32 pitch, taken as 8/6-in. or 1.33-in. dia.<br>
1-1/8-in. dia. Roll, 16 pitch, taken as 10/6-in. or 1. 67-in. dia.<br>
1-in dia. Roll, 16 pitch, taken as 9/6-in. or 1.50-in. dia.<br>

<h1>PRODUCTION CALCULATIONS </h1>

<p class=center>
<img src="images/i095.jpg" alt="[Illustration]"  border=1>
</p>

<p>
The greater production with Metallic Rolls
over Common Rolls for a given number of revs. is
due to the meshing of the flutes, which increases the
effective circum. of the rolls about 33 per cent. This
accounts for the difference in the gears driving the
Calender Rolls.
</p>
<p>
Short rules for production in 10 hours based on 20 per
cent. allowance for stops, etc., and 1-3/8 in. dia. front
bottom roll.
</p>
<p>
<i>Common Rolls</i>&mdash;.852 x R. P. M. of Front Roll x Wt. of
Sliver in grains = Lbs. in 10 hours.
</p>
<p>
<i>Metallic Rolls</i>&mdash;1.126 x R. P. M. of Front Roll x Wt. of
Sliver in grains = Lbs. in 10 hours.

SECTION OF DRAWING FRAME<br>
SHOWING ELECTRIC STOP MOTIONS
</p>

<a name="99">{99}</a>

<h1>EXPLANATION OF ELECTRIC STOP MOTIONS.</h1>
<p>
Our improved Magneto or Dynamo for producing
current to operate the Stop Motions is designed
on the "Induction" principle, so that the
current is generated in the stationary winding, and
no brushes or collectors are needed. This type of
machine is very simple, requires little attention,
and gives a steady current, no matter how much
dirt, lint or oil collects on same.
</p>
<p>
The Drawing Frame is divided into two parts
by means of insulations (indicated by the solid
black portions of cut on <a href="#98">opposite page</a>). One part,
shown with double cross lines, is connected to the
Magneto through the down-rod A, and the other
part through the down-rod B.
</p>
<p>
It will be seen that in the case of each Stop
Motion the parts are kept from touching each other
by cotton passing between them (cotton being a
non-conductor of electricity) or are brought into
contact with each other by rollers lapping up or by
the pressure of the cotton in the full cans.
</p>
<p>
The machine stops when the electric circuit is
completed, allowing the current to flow through
Magnet T, which attracts finger U into engagement
with Revolving Clutch V, and by a mechanical
arrangement shifts the belt on to the loose pulley.
</p>
<p>
As the frame stops, the part X forces the finger
U away from the Clutch, and the current is broken
by the piece Y which moves out of contact with the
spring Z. When the frame is running, Y is in contact
with both the springs Z and J. As the machine
stops, the movement of Y takes it out of contact with
Z, but J should always press against Y.
</p>
<a name="100">{100}</a>
<p>
<b>STOP MOTION No. 1</b>&mdash;C is the top electric roll
which rests in Cap Bar D, and E is the bottom electric
roll. As long as the sliver remains between
the rolls they are kept apart and there is no circuit.
When the sliver breaks or a can runs out the rolls
come together and the frame knocks off.
</p>
<p>
<b>STOP MOTION No.2</b>&mdash;The Top Clearer Cover H
has a screw K on the under side. If the cotton
laps around the top or bottom front roll, the top
roll is lifted and comes in contact with screw K,
which completes the circuit and the machine stops.
</p>
<p>
<b>STOP MOTION No. 3</b>&mdash;The cotton sliver prevents
the calender rolls L and M from touching each other.
If the sliver breaks, the rolls touch and the machine
stops instantly.
</p>
<p>
<b>STOP MOTION No. 4</b>&mdash;When the cans at the front
are full and cotton presses against the coiler top N,
it is lifted into contact with the spring O, and the
circuit is completed, stopping the machine.
</p>
<p>
<b>STOP MOTION No.5</b>&mdash;The Underclearer P presses
against the bottom electric roll E. In case the cotton
laps around E or P, the screw Q is lifted and
touches the Back Plate G, completes the circuit and
the frame knocks off.

SLUBBING FRAME (RIGHT HAND)
</p>

<a name="103">{103}</a>

<h1>SLUBBING, INTERMEDIATE, ROVING
AND JACK FRAMES. </h1>
<p>
These frames are so well known to the users of Cotton
Machinery that no general description is necessary. They
have extra heavy framing, are made entirely by special
tools, and all parts are exact duplicates. They are of superior
construction and finish, and will stand the highest speeds
without vibration or breakage. They contain many valuable
patented improvements, some of which are described below.
</p>
<p>
<b>PATENT SWING</b>&mdash;Well supported and with one (large)
Carrier Gear only.
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPROVED DIFFERENTIAL MOTION</b>&mdash;This motion
effects a great saving in power, wear and tear, and gives more
accurate winding and consequently evener and better work.
See <a href="#106">page 106</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPROVED LAY GEARING</b> dispenses with all bevel
change gears, gives two change places instead of one, is
simple and convenient, and allows free access to the main
gearing. See <a href="#109">page 109</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPROVED METHOD OF LIFTING AND LOWERING
BOTTOM CONE DRUM</b>&mdash;Both ends of the cone are raised
or lowered together from the front of the machine. The belt
is kept at a uniform tension from one end of the cone to the
other. A patent locking device secures the cone in its proper
working position, after doffing, preventing all movement or
vibration.
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPROVED METHOD OF TIGHTENING THE CONE
BELT</b> does away with frequent taking-up. When slack, the
belt may be tightened in a few moments by means of a
Quadrant Bracket. Over 5 in. of stretch can be taken care
of without re-piecing. A great saving is effected in labor,
stoppages and cone belts.
</p>
<p>
<b>WINDING BACK THE RACK AND CONE BELT</b> is done
from the front of the machine.
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPROVED SYSTEM OF BALANCING THE TOP OR
BOBBIN RAIL</b>&mdash;This rail, with its gearing, collars, bobbins,
etc., is now supported under its center of gravity by a set of
levers, thus relieving the slides and racks of this weight.
This system prevents friction and wear of slides, also the
tendency to dwell at the changes of the traverse both top and
bottom.
</p>
<a name="104">{104}</a>
<p class=center>
<img src="images/i104.jpg" alt="[Illustration]"  border=1>
<br>
ROVING FRAME (RIGHT HAND)
</p>

<a name="105">{105}</a>

<p>
If slides wear, the Long Collars tilt forward, the top rail,
spindles, bobbins and flyers vibrate, causing bad work and loss
of production. This is prevented by our improved system.
</p>
<p>
<b>PATENT REVERSING AND LET-OFF MOTION</b> entirely
prevents the roving running over the ends on the changes.
The speed of the bobbin changes simultaneously with the
reversal of the lifting rail and thus overcomes the liability of
stretching the roving.
</p>
<p>
<b>FULL BOBBIN STOP MOTION</b> is very effective in its
action and prevents overfilling the bobbins. The frame cannot
be started after the completion of a set until doffed and
the rack has been wound back.
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPROVED TOP CLEARERS</b>&mdash;These are made of
polished steel, very light and easy to clean. The hinging is so
arranged that any clearer can be easily removed.
</p>
<p>
<b>LONG COLLARS OR BOLSTERS</b> are fastened in a
vertical position by an improved method which prevents their
working loose. They are bored throughout their entire
length, thus reducing the liability of dirt accumulating inside
and causing the spindles to bind.
</p>
<p>
<b>PATENT RECESSED SELF-LUBRICATING SPINDLE
FOOT</b>&mdash;This has proved one of the most successful
inventions, and is in extensive use. It ensures constant
lubrication, prevents wear, and is easily kept clean.
</p>
<p>
<b>BEARINGS INLAID WITH BRASS</b>&mdash;All
Bobbin and Spindle Shaft Bearings, Roller
Stands and Slides are inlaid with brass.
</p>
<p class=center>
<img src="images/i105.jpg" alt="[Illustration]"  border=1>
</p>

<p>
<b>DRIVING ENDS OF BOBBIN AND SPINDLE
SHAFTS</b> are case hardened and are in short
lengths, so that they can be easily taken out
even when frames are placed end to end with
narrow passages between them. This is a great
convenience, as it avoids the necessity of having
to remove a great many shaft gears. The shafts
can be lifted out with the gears on them.
</p>
<p>
<b>AUTOMATIC PANEL LOCKING ARRANGEMENT</b>
prevents the frame from being started if any of the gearing end
panels are not in place.
</p>
<a name="106">{106}</a>

<p class=center>
<img src="images/i106.jpg" alt="[Illustration]"  border=1>
<br>
DIFFERENTIAL MOTION
</p>

<a name="107">{107}</a>
<h1>IMPROVED DIFFERENTIAL MOTION. </h1>
<p>
All the gears on the Jack Shaft revolve in the
same direction as the shaft itself. This reduces
considerably the work the cone belt has to do, saves
power, and gives more accurate winding and evener
and better work.
</p>
<p>
A<sup>1</sup> (40 teeth) drives the Spindle Shafts and S<sup>1</sup>
(50 teeth) drives the Bobbin Shafts. The gears on
the Spindle and Bobbin Shafts are alike, i. e., they
have the same number of teeth.
</p>
<p>
As the cut shows the number of teeth in all
the gears of the Differential, it will readily be seen
that if Q and Q<sup>1</sup> are held stationary, the speed of
S<sup>1</sup> will be retarded 1 rev. for every 5 revs. the Jack
Shaft makes, and the spindles and bobbins will be
running at the same speed, no winding taking
place. Winding is produced by the bobbins
running faster than the spindles, therefore Q, which
is driven from the bottom cone through carrier
gears, must revolve. Its speed changes as the
bobbins increase in diameter, being governed by the
position of the cone belt, which is shifted slightly
as each layer is put on the bobbins.
</p>
<a name="108">{108}</a>
<p>
<b>CASING-OFF PLATES</b>&mdash;The Front Casing-off Plates for
Bobbin and Spindle Shafts are made of polished steel and are
circular in shape. They are light, strong, cannot be broken,
and are easily kept clean.
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPROVED CAP BARS</b>&mdash;Cast-iron Cap Bars give trouble
on account of the fingers being twisted, and frequent breakages.
The illustrations show the construction of our improved
Cap Bar, which entirely obviates these difficulties.
Figure 1 is a back view of our Cap Bar applied to a machine
with four spindles in a box, and Figure 2 an end view of
same. Figures 3, 4 and 5 show enlarged details.
</p>
<p class=center>
<img src="images/i108.jpg" alt="[Illustration]"  border=1>
<br>
IMPROVED CAP BARS
</p>
<p>
The Cap Bars are fastened to the Roller Stands by brackets
which are independent of the slides, and consequently the
rolls can be set without moving the Cap Bars. When
resetting the rolls it is only necessary to adjust the nebs for the
middle and back lines, as the front nebs do not have to be
disturbed.
</p>
<a name="109">{109}</a>
<h1>IMPROVED LAY GEARING. </h1>
<p class=center>
<img src="images/i109.jpg" alt="[Illustration]"  border=1>
</p>
<p>
To facilitate making changes in the Lay Gears, we have
provided two change places instead of one. Formerly it was
the practice to change the gear on the end of the Reversing
Shaft or the one between the Reversing Bevels.
</p>
<p>
In order to bring the change gears into a more convenient
position and at the same time increase the range, we
have introduced two additional spur gears. One of these is
now the regular change gear, and is on a stud carried by an
adjustable Quadrant Bracket. The short shaft carrying the
bevel gears is now in a horizontal position instead of vertical.
</p>
<a name="110">{110}</a>
<p>
Besides providing for two change places, this improvement
dispenses with the Back Cross Rail and allows free
access to the main gearing. Any part of the gearing can be
taken out and replaced with ease.
</p>
<p>
There is no longer any necessity of changing any bevel
gears. There are two spur gear changes, either of which
may be used and which give a very wide range. The entire
arrangement is very simple and convenient.
</p>

<p class=center>
<img src="images/i110.jpg" alt="[Illustration]"  border=1>
</p>
<p>
Other sizes of Spindles, Long Collars, Bobbin Gear
Tops and Rolls will be supplied when necessary.

given hank roving:
</p>
<a name="129">{129}</a>
<p>
1 hank or below, 7.5 x square root of hank = Laps per Inch<br><br>
1 hank to 2 hanks, 8.5 x square root of hank = Laps per Inch<br> <br>
2 hanks to 3 hanks, 9.5 x square root of hank = Laps per Inch<br> <br>
3 hanks to 4 hanks, 10.0 x square root of hank = Laps per Inch<br> <br>
4 hanks and above, 10.5 x square root of hank = Laps per Inch<br>
</p>
<p>
Good results are obtained by using 9.3 x square
root of hank.
</p>
<h2>TAPER AND TENSION CALCULATIONS. </h2>
<p>
It is difficult to give hard and fast rules for
figuring the Taper and Tension Gears, as the
required number of teeth on these gears is affected
by the kind of stock, length of staple, amount of
twist, temperature and humidity.

the number of teeth on the Reversing Shaft Change Gear Z<sup>2</sup>
and take the constant which corresponds in the table below.
For example, the lay constant for a frame with gearing like
No.4 combination and a 16 T. Reversing Shaft Change Gear
is 437.9. This divided by the number of teeth on the Lay

RING SPINNING FRAME&mdash;HEAD END
</p>

<a name="141">{141}</a>

<h1>RING SPINNING FRAMES. </h1>
<p>
The introduction of these machines was preceded
by a careful study of what had already been
done in Spinning Frame design.
</p>
<p>
Our Improved Ring Spinning Frames are made
from entirely new patterns, and not only combine
the best features previously brought out in such
machines, but also many new ideas and improvements
which have proved of great benefit to both
manufacturers and spinners.
</p>
<p>
Although these frames were only introduced a
few years ago, they are very extensively used, and
the demand is steadily increasing. All parts are
machined and most of them are made by specially
designed tools.
</p>
<p>
We give below a description of the construction
and chief points of advantage of these machines.
</p>
<p>
<b>LOW FRAMING AND CONSTRUCTION</b>&mdash;The Frames
are built very low, are extra heavy in all their
principal parts, and are designed and constructed
so as to stand high speeds without vibration, thus
preserving the spindles, ensuring light running and
reducing the cost of repairs.
</p>
<p>
<b>SPINDLE RAILS</b>&mdash;These are of the box pattern,
specially heavy, and designed to prevent springing,
twisting and vibration.
</p>
<p>
<b>LIFTING RODS</b>&mdash;The Lifting Rods, as will be
seen in the several illustrations, do not have any
foot castings attached to them. They can therefore
be easily taken out, cleaned and put back
without the necessity of readjustment. These rods
are accurately turned and finished by a special
process to prevent sticking. The Wave Shaft
Arms are designed so that the Ring Rails can be
easily leveled by means of adjusting screws.
</p>
<p>
<b>CREELS</b>&mdash;The Creels are constructed with large
diameter supporting rods so as to ensure rigidity,
reduce vibration and prevent stretching the roving.
</p>
<a name="142">{142}</a>

<p class=center>

<br>
DOUBLE ADJUSTABLE RING IN PLATE HOLDER
<br><br>
DOUBLE RING IN CAST-IRON HOLDER, WITH PATENT
CONCEALED TRAVELER CLEARER
<br><br>
SOLID SINGLE FLANGE RINGS
</p>

<a name="143">{143}</a>
<p>
<b>FLUTED ROLLS</b>&mdash;These steel rolls are carefully and
accurately made from superior stock by special
machinery. They have large Necks and Squares
and are irregularly fluted so as not to cut the Top
Rolls.
</p>
<p>
<b>TOP ROLLS</b>&mdash;These have taper ends or pivots, and
the Cap Bar Nebs are milled to correspond, thus
making it easy to pick the ends and keep them clean.
</p>
<p>
<b>CAP BARS</b>&mdash;These are made with steel fingers
which do not break. The upper surface of each
finger is flat. The Cap Bar Nebs, which slide on
the fingers, are milled and are fastened in position
by cap or frog screws so that they cannot twist or
get out of place. This arrangement enables the
Top Rolls to be accurately set, and makes it much
more easy to see the necks of the Bottom Rolls and
keep them properly lubricated without removing
the Top Rolls or Cap Bars.
</p>
<p>
<b>RE-LEVELLING</b>&mdash;This is now an easy matter and
quickly done. Packing up the feet is no longer
necessary. The foot of each Spring Piece is provided
with a shoe and jack screw, by which it can
be raised or lowered to meet any unevenness in the
floor.
</p>
<p>
<b>TRAVERSE RODS AND GUIDES</b>&mdash;Iron Traverse Rods
are applied, to which are attached adjustable Brass
Trumpet Guides.
</p>
<p>
<b>ADJUSTABLE THREAD BOARDS</b>&mdash;Our Thread Boards
are adjustable. They can be raised or lowered so
as to give, within reasonable limits, any required
distance between the Spindle points and Thread
Guides.

RING SPINNING FRAME-FOOT END
</p>

<a name="145">{145}</a>

<p>
<b>RINGS</b>&mdash;We furnish Single Flange Rings, Double
Rings in cast iron Holders, with or without Patent
Wire Traveler Clearers, or Double Adjustable
Rings in Plate Holders with Traveler Clearers. All
Rings are made and finished in the most accurate
manner, from a special grade of steel and hardened
by improved methods.
</p>
<p>
<b>SPINDLES</b>&mdash;We supply any of the latest improved
types of Spindles.
</p>
<p>
<b>SEPARATORS</b>&mdash;We supply the Rhodes-Chandler,
Sharples, Doyle or H. & B. (our own). See description,
<a href="#153">page 153</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>SADDLES</b>&mdash;The Dixon ordinary, Dixon adjustable
or common Saddles are applied as required.
</p>
<p>
<b>LEVER SCREWS</b>&mdash;The Speakman or Common are
furnished as specified.
</p>

<a name="146">{146}</a>

<p>
<b>DRIVING PULLEYS</b> are of our own improved
design. The Loose Pulley runs on a cast iron
sleeve, which is a part of the ring oiling box. Oil
passes through holes in the bottom of this sleeve
and lubricates the Loose Pulley. Our method of
supporting the shaft and Loose Pulley together with
the perfect lubrication of both prevents the wearing
of the shaft, sleeve or Loose Pulley.

<br>
RING OILING OUTRIGGER BEARING AND SELF
LUBRICATING LOOSE PULLEY
</p>

<p>
The Fast Pulley is usually made slightly larger
in diameter than the Loose Pulley and is secured to
the shaft by a Woodruff key and set screws.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE OUTRIGGER</b> for supporting the Driving
Pulleys can be applied at either the head or foot
end, as specified.
</p>

<a name="147">{147}</a>

<p>
Our improved Cylinder Head is made with a
wide surface for the tin and has a long hub split at
the end for several inches.
</p>
<p>
The split portion of the hub is made to grip the
shaft by means of a heavy clamp ring and set screw.
The shaft cannot be cut by this set screw as it bears
on the split hub.
</p>

<p class=center>
<img src="images/i147.jpg" alt="[Illustration]"  border=1>
<br>
CYLINDER HEAD BEARING AND CAP
</p>

<p>
The shafts are steel, fitted with Woodruff Keys
and Phosphor Bronze Bushes with Collars, which
make the bearings self-oiling and practically free
from wear. Heavy tin is used in the construction
of the Cylinders which are carefully balanced and
thoroughly tested.

TWIST GEARING
</p>

<p>
Simplicity and convenience characterize our
Ring Spinning Frame gearing. All gears are
cut. They are of ample width, run quietly and
are well boxed to prevent accidents.
</p>

<p>
The change gears are very conveniently
located and a wide range of draft and twist can
easily be obtained.

<br>
BUILDER FOR RING SPINNING FRAME
</p>

<a name="151">{151}</a>

<h1>IMPROVED BUILDER. </h1>
<p>
When designing our improved Spinning Frame Builder,
special attention was given to obtaining a wide range in form
and build of bobbin combined with simplicity and durability.
The changes necessary when altering the wind, pick or traverse
have been reduced to a minimum.
</p>
<p>
The Builder is a combination type, and the change from
warp to filling, or vice versa, can be easily and quickly made.
</p>
<p>
The illustration shows a filling cam only on the cam shaft,
but when warp and filling wind are wanted, two cams are
placed on this shaft.
</p>
<p>
The length of the traverse is determined by the adjustable
Wave Shaft Stud, which can be easily and quickly raised or
lowered, and the Ring Rail can be placed at the correct starting
point by means of a thumb nut.

The Pick or Take-up Motion is very simple. The pawl is
on a plate which has a gear at the back. This gear is driven
by a Quadrant which is connected to the top of the Builder.
The pawl shield is set so that any required number of teeth
can be taken up and no change gears are used.
</p>
<p>
In the Builder Arm is an adjusting screw, which is used
with warp wind to regulate the taper on the bobbin. The
taper can be decreased at the bottom and increased at the top
by turning in this screw.
</p>
<p>
When the foot lever is pressed, it throws the Worm out of
gear and allows the rail to be dropped. After winding back
the Pick Motion, the Frame is ready for doffing and starting a
new set.
</p>
<p>
An eccentric device is applied to enable the "Socket
Doff" to be used when desired.
</p>
<p>
The Worm Gear Shaft is driven by a sprocket chain in
the bead end. The speed of this shaft and consequently the
speed of the traverse is increased or decreased by changing
the Sprocket Gear.
</p>
<p>
The bevel gears are well protected from dust and fly by a
cover, and the Builder screw itself is provided with a cleaner
which prevents the collection of dirt in the threads.

<br>
HOWARD & BULLOUGH PATENT AUTOMATIC SEPARATOR
</p>

<a name="153">{153}</a>

<h1>HOWARD & BULLOUGH PATENT AUTOMATIC
SEPARATOR </h1>

<p>
It has been our aim to combine in this new
Separator simplicity and lightness with effectiveness
and rigidity. All Separators collect lint, but
the Howard & Bullough has so few parts and is so
easily cleaned that this disadvantage is reduced to
a minimum. The Separator rod holders, which
allow the blades to be thrown back out of position
for doffing, are neat and strong.
</p>
<p>
Vibration in a Separator means bad work, and
we have given special attention to this point, as
evidenced by the double bearings for the lifting
rods, the stiffness of the Separator rod carrying the
blades, and the general design. In case the operator
neglects to return the blades to their working
position after doffing, this is taken care of by a
curved stop or bracket attached to the roller beam.
Easy adjustment for both long and short traverse
is a good feature of this Separator.
</p>

<h1>FLOOR SPACE OF RING SPINNING FRAMES. </h1>

<p class=center>
<img src="images/i154.jpg" alt="[Illustration]"  border=1>
</p>
<p>
We make 36-in. or 39-in. framing as required.
When extra large diameter roving bobbins are
used and the creels are required to take double
roving, the 39-in. framing is needed to obtain
enough space in the creels.
</p>
<p>
To ascertain the length of Spinning Frames
with any number of spindles: Multiply one-half the
number of spindles by the gauge and add 2 ft. 1 in.
for head and off ends.
</p>
<p>
Although it is advantageous when possible to
keep to the number of spindles given in the table
on the opposite page, other lengths can be built, but
even boxes are preferable.

<h1>RING TWISTERS. </h1>

<h2>FOR DRY OR WET TWISTING. </h2>
<p>
Our Ring Twister resembles our Spinning Frame, both
in construction and design, and the descriptive matter on
<a href="#140">pages 140</a> and <a href="#151">151</a> apply to this machine.
</p>
<p>
The marked success of our Spinning Frame led us to
build a Twister embodying the same improvements and
special features which have been so much appreciated. All
parts are machined, and are interchangeable.
</p>
<p>
<b>LOW FRAMING AND HEAVY RIGID CONSTRUCTION</b>&mdash;
The frames are built very low, are extra heavy in all their
principal parts and are designed and constructed so as to
stand high speeds without vibration, thus preserving the
spindles, insuring light running and reducing the cost of
repairs.
</p>
<p>
<b>DRY AND WET TWISTING</b>&mdash;We build machines for
either Dry or Wet Twisting. When for wet work the bottom
and top rolls are covered with brass, and brass troughs are
provided for the water. The yarn is submerged by means of
glass rods which are easily raised or lowered.
</p>
<p>
<b>ARRANGEMENT OF ROLLS</b>&mdash;Machines are built with
any of the following arrangements of Rolls:
</p>
<p class="cite">
Single Line Bottom Rolls, and Single Line Top Rolls. <br>
Double Line Bottom Rolls, and Single Line Top Rolls. <br>
Double Line Bottom Rolls, and Double Line Top Rolls.
</p>
<p>
<b>SPINDLES</b>&mdash;Any of the improved modern high-speed
spindles are supplied as required. We do not make any
Twisters with common or old style "Two Rail" spindles.
</p>
<p>
<b>KNEE BRAKES</b> are furnished when required.
</p>
<p>
<b>GAUGES AND RINGS</b>&mdash;We build machines from 2-1/2-in.
gauge with 1-1/2-in. rings up to 5-1/2-in. gauge with 4-1/2-in.
rings. Any desired form or style of ring will be furnished.
All of these rings are made from high-grade steel of special
analysis, hardened by improved methods and accurately
finished.

CONE WINDER
</p>

<a name="223">{223}</a>

<h1>CONE AND TUBE WINDERS. </h1>

<p>
Although these machines are adapted to the
winding of all kinds of yarns, they are especially
good for soft hosiery and underwear yarns which
should be handled so as to retain their full strength
and elasticity.
</p>
<p>
<b>OPEN WIND</b>&mdash;This feature of our machine, together
with its general improved construction, enables
it to wind the most delicate yarns. The open
wind with its irregular coils is of great advantage, as
stretching of the yarn is avoided and it unwinds
freely in the knitting process.
</p>
<p>
<b>CONE AND PARALLEL WIND</b>&mdash;These machines are
built for winding either cones or parallel tubes, from
cops, bobbins, spools or skeins.
</p>
<p>
<b>STOP MOTIONS</b>&mdash;These are applied to all machines.
The Detector Holders and Drop Wires are
supplied for one or more ply, as required. When a
thread breaks, the individual drum stops, thus preventing
waste or single. The Stop Motions are
quick and positive, and the piecing up is very easily
done.
</p>
<p>
<b>FRAMING AND CONSTRUCTION</b>&mdash;The Winders are
strong and durable. No wood is used in their construction,
except for the top shelves and Friction
Boards. All gearing is cut. The Casing-off Plates
on each side are hinged, which facilitates cleaning.
</p>
<p>
<b>UNIFORM TENSION</b>&mdash;The conical and parallel
Mandrels are driven by friction from the drums, and
consequently the increase in diameter of the cones
or tubes does not alter the tension on the yarn.
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPROVED MANDRELS</b>&mdash;These fit firmly in the
paper cones at both ends. The cones are very easily
removed, and although they may vary in size or
shape, any irregularities are taken care of by the
Mandrels.
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPROVED REVERSING MOTION</b>&mdash;The durability of
Winders and the uniformity of the winding depends
<a name="224">{224}</a>
to a great extent on the accuracy and wearing qualities
of the Reversing Motion. The cam and bowl
in this motion are of hardened steel, and the cam
runs in oil.
</p>
<p>
Our Motion gives an instantaneous reversal, and
prevents the throwing over of the yarn at the ends,
ensuring a perfectly shaped cone or parallel Tube.
</p>
<p>
<b>ADJUSTABLE TRAVERSE</b>&mdash;The length of the
traverse can be adjusted from 4 in. to 6 in. by a
very simple method.
</p>
<p>
<b>AVAILABLE SPEED TRAVERSE</b>&mdash;By means of a
change gear on the Main Driving Shaft, the ratio of
the speed of the traverse to the speed of the drum
can be altered. A ratio which is best suited to
coarse yarn is not the best for fine yarn. The work
which these machines are called upon to do may
vary from winding very coarse ply yarns to fine
single yarns, and a variable speed traverse is of
advantage.
</p>
<p>
<b>DRIVING PULLEYS</b>&mdash;These are 18 in. dia., 2-1/2 in.
face, Tight and Loose, and usually make 100 to 125
revs., according to the class of work.
</p>
<p>
<b>PRODUCTION</b>&mdash;Based on 125 revs. of Driving
Pulleys, with 20 per cent allowance for stops, the
production per drum per week of 60 hours figures
500 hanks (hanks/number of yarn = lbs.)
</p>

CYLINDER SIZING MACHINE OR SLASHER
</p>

<a name="229">{229}</a>

<h1>SLASHERS. </h1>
<p>
The Slasher System of Sizing was invented by Mr. James
Bullough, and Slashers were first made and put on the
market by Howard & Bullough, Ltd.
</p>
<p>
The advent of the Slasher, dispensing as it did with the
old systems of Sizing, is recognized as one of the greatest inventions
of the age. Probably no other invention was
ever taken up and supplanted other systems with such rapidity
as that of the Slasher, in every cotton manufacturing country.
Although Slashers are now made by others, the Howard
& Bullough machine still keeps the lead, and improvements
are being continually added.
</p>
<p>
<b>NEW PATTERNS</b>&mdash;The machines are now made from new
patterns with extra heavy framing, with broad flanges, planed
edges, and milled doubled-flanged joints, giving great
strength and solidity. All seatings, cross-rails, principal
brackets and fixings are planed or milled.
</p>
<p>
<b>HEADSTOCKS</b>&mdash;These are made in three lengths, Short
(8 ft. 6 in.), Medium (10 ft. 4 in.) and Long (12 ft. 2 in.), and
are complete with Fan, Conducting Rollers, Polished Dividing
Rods, quick and accurate Yarn Marker, Expanding and
Contracting Comb, Spring Bearings for preventing the breaking
of yarn when starting the machine, Triple Speed Change
Gears, Slow Motion arrangement, Side Shaft, and Gearing
to Copper Size Rollers, Patent Yarn Beam Friction and
Patent Revolving Yarn Beam Presser.
</p>
<p>
<b>PATENT YARN BEAM FRICTION</b>&mdash;With four frictional
surfaces. These Frictions have more than double the friction
surface of the older styles, and give considerably more power
and are proving the most efficient Frictions ever invented.
</p>
<p>
<b>SLOW MOTION DRIVING</b>&mdash;This enables the Slasher to be
run at a very slow speed, instead of being entirely stopped
whilst doffing, etc., thus preventing the burning or spoiling
of yarn whilst under the squeezing rollers in the size box.

<a name="230">{230}</a>

<p>
<b>COPPER CYLINDERS</b>&mdash;Made from best Copper Sheets
well and evenly rolled by machinery, so as to give a perfectly
smooth drying surface, with Ends or Heads made of Steel
plates. Cylinder Shafts run on Anti-Friction Bowls, and are
provided with Pressure Gauge, Safety and Reducing Valves,
and Steam Traps.
</p>
<p>
<b>SIZE BOX</b>&mdash;With two Heavy Seamless Copper Rollers,
with Brass Glands and Brass Bushes. The Ends of these
Rollers run in Brass Steps in Pedestals supported by Tables
which are cast to the outside of the Size Box.
</p>
<p>
Size Box also contains perforated Copper Boiling Pipe,
Seamless Copper Immersion Roller, with adjustable Racks
and Motion, Brass and Tin Conducting Rollers, and Brass
Taps.
</p>
<p>
<b>CREELS</b>&mdash;These are usually made for 6 Beams, but are
made for more if required, and have Adjustable Bearings.
Three sizes are made, 22-3/8 in., 25-1/2 in. and 27 in. between
centers. The latter for Beam Heads up to 26 in. dia.
</p>
<p>
We also apply, when ordered, any of the following:
</p>
<p>
Patent Traversing Yarn Beam Presser.
</p>
<p>
Patent Expanding Double Yarn Beam Presser.
</p>
<p>
Patent Yarn Tension Arrangement to Size Box for
enabling the size to better penetrate the Yarns.
</p>
<p>
Positive Driving Arrangement to Cylinders for Fine
Yarns or small number of ends.
</p>
<p>
Extra Carrying Rolls and Stands.
</p>
<p>
<b>PRODUCTION</b>&mdash;One Slasher will supply from 150 to 600
Looms, according to the class of work; about 300 is the
average.
</p>
<p>
<b>DRIVING PULLEYS</b>&mdash;Are on Right Hand side of
Head-stock (when facing same), 13 in. dia., 3 in. face, T. & L.
Slow Motion Pulley is 1 in. face, making 7 in. in width for
the three Pulleys.
</p>
<p>

<h1>ENGLISH WEIGHTS AND MEASURES OF
COTTON YARN. </h1>
<p>
24 Grains = l Pennyweight (Dwt. Troy). <br>
437.5 Grains = 1 Ounce (Avoirdupois).<br>
16 oz. = 7,000 Grains = l Pound (Avoirdupois). <br>
1-1/2 Yards = 54 in. = 1 thread or circumference of Cotton Reel. <br>
120 Yards = 80 threads = l Skein. <br>
840 Yards = 560 threads = 7 skeins = 1 Hank. <br>
The number of Hanks in 1 lb. is the number of the yarn. <br>
7,000 grains (1 lb.) divided by the weight in grains of 1
Hank (840 Yards) = the number of yarn. <br>
</p>
<p>
It is unnecessary and inconvenient to measure and weigh
a full hank, and a lesser number of yards are usually taken.
120 yards for yarn, and 12 yards for Roving are common, and
the Dividends for these are given in the following table.

Divide 7,000 (Grains in 1 lb.) by 840 (yards in 1 Hank) = dividend for 1 yd., 8.33.<br>
Dividend/by weight in grains = Hank. <br>
Dividend/by Hank = Weight in Grains. <br>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
